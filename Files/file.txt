The Bird of Hermes is my name,
Eating my wings to make me tame.
In the Sea withouten lesse,
Standeth the Bird of Hermes:
Eating his Wings variable,
And thereby maketh himselfe more stable;
When all his Fethers be agone,
He standeth still there as a stone;
Here is now both White and Red,
And also the Stone to quicken the dead,
All and sume withouten fable,
Both hard, and nesh and milliable
Understand now well aright,
And thanke God of this sight.
